pancit molo

Pancit Molo is another traditional Ilonggo soup dish that originated from the town of Molo in Iloilo, where several Chinese immigrants lived in the past. Itâ€™s a soup highly similar to the famous Wonton Soup of the Chinese.

These Molo Dumplings, usually made of ground pork and a combination of different herbs and spices, are made more hearty and exquisite with shredded chicken and toasted garlic. Yum!
