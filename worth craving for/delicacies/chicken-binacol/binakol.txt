Chicken Binakol

Chicken Binakol, on the other hand, is another iconic Ilonggo chicken dish but this time in the form of a hearty soup. This oneâ€™s highly similar to Chicken Tinola, but what makes it unique is coconut meat water and coconut water as soup bases. Chicken Binakol is also best cooked using native chicken and simmered for several hours.
