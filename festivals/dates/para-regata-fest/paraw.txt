
Paraw Regatta Festival (Iloilo City; 3rd week of February) 

Samba de Regatta is a celebration of Ilonggo seafaring ingenuity! It is a celebration expressed in music and dance. The Samba de Regatta Music and Mardi Gras Competition is hoped to be slowly developed into another tourism spectacle of the city. Conceived to be a special event after the take-off of the competing “Paraws” to entertain the anxious spectators, it has gained the acceptance and enjoyment of the witnessing regatta crowd along the beach of Villa in Arevalo.
