Bantayan  Festival (Guimbal; Last week of March)


The municipality of Guimbal, situated outside the city of Iloilo, will be home to local and international tourists alike as it stages the annual Bantayan Festival which commemorates the foundation of Guimbal as a settlement. In this fete, two symbols which represent the town are commemorated: the Bantayan, or the watch towers which served as the guard against the Moro invaders who attempted to besiege the town, and the Gimba or drum, which stands for merrymaking among the crowd. A lot of activities are lined up by the municipal government for the festivities, among them a fluvial parade sponsored by the church, streetdancing within the town center, a beauty pageant participated by the townâ€™s fine ladies, and cultural and sports contests participated by the active townsfolk.
